# Video Editor → Mac App — Project Handoff

Paste this file (and the project zip) into a new Claude conversation at any time
and say "continue this project" — it has everything needed to pick up where we
left off.

## Goal
Turn the browser-based B-roll/avatar video editor (originally a section inside
a bigger `index.html` production-board site) into an installable Mac desktop
app: download a `.dmg`, drag to Applications, double-click to open. No Terminal
required to use it. Target: Apple Silicon (M4), later a universal build.

## The 4-step plan (step 3 was split in two)
1. **Step 1 — Electron shell (this delivery).** Extract the editor's HTML/CSS/JS
   out of the big site into a standalone page, wrap it in a minimal Electron
   app, and set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a `.dmg` on a cloud
   Mac (so the user never needs a command line). Editor behavior is unchanged
   from the browser version: still uses `<input type=file>`, the canvas-based
   preview/compositor, and the WebCodecs-based "Fast render (MP4)" button.
   Cut detection is still the old frame-seeking JS scan (slow, but unchanged).
2. **Step 2 — ffmpeg integration.** Bundle a macOS ffmpeg binary. Add:
   - `ffprobe`-based media info instead of guessing from `<video>` metadata.
   - One-pass ffmpeg scan to replace the slow JS cut-detection scan (rewritten in v0.4.1, see "Cut detection rewrite").
   - Lightweight preview proxies (720p H.264) for any clip Chromium can't play
     natively, so the in-app preview stays smooth regardless of source codec.
   - Native open/save dialogs via Electron's `dialog` module (replacing the
     `<input type=file>` pickers), and reading/writing API keys through
     `safeStorage` (macOS Keychain) instead of `localStorage`.
   - IPC bridge in `preload.js` (`window.vem.*`) connecting the page to these
     main-process capabilities.
3. **Step 3A — ffmpeg render pipeline.** Replace the in-browser canvas/MediaRecorder
   export with an ffmpeg render that matches the preview (crossfades, Ken Burns zoom,
   rounded corners, border ring, background layer). 1080p / 2K / 4K, native save dialog,
   progress + cancel.
4. **Step 3B — polish + packaging.** App icon, ad-hoc code signing of the app and the
   bundled ffmpeg, CI sanity checks, final `.dmg`.

## STATUS: Steps 1, 2, 3A and 3B are DONE (code-complete). Next: user builds the .dmg and tests on the Mac.

## Cut detection rewrite (v0.4.1) — replaces the old ffmpeg `scene` threshold
Problem seen on real footage: one continuous shot (motion/flicker) was chopped into ~25 half-second
clips at the default slider, and raising the slider lost real cuts (and crossfades were never found).
A per-frame "how big is the jump" threshold can't fix both at once.

New method (`src/scene-detect.js`, frames come from `src/thumb-extract.js`):
- ONE ffmpeg pass decodes every frame to a 32x18 RGB thumbnail (+ exact pts from showinfo).
- Hard cut = spike that stands out from the LOCAL motion level AND the picture 3 frames before vs 3 after
  is really different (low quantile, so 1-2 frame flashes/pops don't count) AND that difference is clearly
  bigger than the jitter inside each side. Different pictures, not just big jumps.
- Crossfade/dissolve = colour+layout of the picture 0.5 s before vs 0.5 s after differs, with a stable
  shot on both sides and clearly above the surrounding change level. Reported at the centre.
- Dip to black / white flash = near-black/white run between two different pictures -> one cut at its centre.
- Min shot length 0.2 s enforced by strongest-wins non-max suppression (no chain merging), then adjacent
  segments that still look like the same shot are merged.
- Boundary time = midpoint between last old frame and first new frame, so no repeated frame at clip starts.
- Slider unchanged (5-150, lower = more cuts) but now it only removes WEAK cuts; obvious cuts survive at 150.
- The editor status line shows "N cuts (H hard, F fades)" and the devtools console prints a table of every
  cut with kind + score (View > Toggle Developer Tools) — send that table if a cut is ever wrong.
- Old `scene`-score approach is gone from detectScenes; the in-page JS scanner is still the fallback if
  ffmpeg fails.

Tested only on synthetic footage generated with ffmpeg (hard cuts, jittery single shot with pops, similar
shots, crossfades, 24->30 fps duplicate frames, 0.6 s rapid cuts, dip-to-black, slow-zoom stills):
default slider = every cut found, 0 false cuts; old method: 25-42 false cuts in the single shot at low
slider, only 3/7 real cuts at slider 100. NOT yet tested on the user's real footage.

## What Step 3B added (on top of 3A; everything else in this zip is the 3A code)
- `build/icon.png` (1024px, generated; replace with your own art any time, same path).
- `scripts/adhoc-sign.js` (electron-builder `afterPack`): ad-hoc `codesign -s -` on the bundled
  ffmpeg/ffprobe first, then the whole .app. `mac.identity: null` so electron-builder does not try
  to sign with a certificate that doesn't exist.
- package.json v0.4.0: arm64-only dmg target, icon, hardenedRuntime off.
- Workflow: new "Sanity-check the packaged app" step prints the bundled ffmpeg version, whether it has
  h264_videotoolbox / libx264, and `codesign --verify`. Read that step's log first if anything is off.

### Not verified (needs a Mac / the Actions run)
- The afterPack signing script and the sanity step have never run (no macOS here). If `codesign`
  complains in CI, the log will say which path.
- Whether ffmpeg-static's mac arm64 build includes h264_videotoolbox: the sanity step answers it.
  If it does not, renders silently use libx264 (slower, GPL note above still applies).
- Intel Macs are not supported by this build (arm64 only). Add `x64` to the dmg arch list later.

### How the ffmpeg render works (src/ffmpeg-render.js)
- Timeline is cut into frame-exact pieces: STEADY (one segment) and ZONE (crossfade between
  two neighbours, via `xfade`). Each piece is a small ffmpeg run encoded with
  h264_videotoolbox (libx264 fallback if the first piece fails), written as MPEG-TS.
  Pieces are joined with the concat demuxer (stream copy) and the avatar audio is muxed as AAC.
- Each "layer" = background (looped bg clip or black) + foreground stretched into the frame box,
  Ken Burns via `perspective`, rounded-corner `alphamerge` mask, overlay, border-ring overlay.
- The renderer draws the mask and border PNGs (canvas) at the exact output size, using
  `vem:get-geometry` for the numbers. Radius and border width are scaled by outH / RENDER_H.
- Avatar file is the master clock (N = avatar duration x 30). B-roll is retimed by `rate`.
- Output is always 30 fps H.264 + AAC, .mp4.

### What Step 3A changed in editor.html
- New "Export size" select (1080p / 2K / 4K) and **Render video (ffmpeg)** + **Cancel render**
  buttons. In the desktop app the old canvas "Fast render" button is hidden; the old code is
  still in the file (used only if window.vem is missing, i.e. plain browser).
- `buildRenderSpec()` collects settings + file paths + mask/border PNG and calls `window.vem.render`.
- "Replace clip" now uses a native dialog (`pickMedia`) and stores `seg.replacePath`
  (ffmpeg needs a real path). Background path is tracked in `bgPath`.
- Image segments (AI-generated) are sent as data URLs and written to temp files in main.

### Verified vs NOT verified
- Verified (Linux sandbox, system ffmpeg 6.1.1 via VEM_FFMPEG): full render of a 6 s test with
  broll + avatar + replaced-image (mirrored) + background + crossfades + border + rounded corners
  -> 1920x1080, exactly 180 frames, 6.000 s, AAC audio; frames inspected by eye.
- Fixed during testing: broll/replaced-video inputs now get `tpad` (clone last frame) so a source
  that ends a hair early can't crash a piece.
- Sandbox quirk (NOT an app bug, probably): the Linux `ffmpeg-static` binary segfaults when reading
  any MPEG-TS file here. Untested whether the macOS build has any issue; if the .dmg render fails at
  "Joining pieces", switch the piece container from mpegts to mp4/matroska in ffmpeg-render.js
  (the `-f mpegts` and `.ts` spots) and use concat-demuxer with mp4 pieces.
- NOT verified: anything on a real Mac (VideoToolbox bitrate/quality, 2K/4K speed, save dialog,
  progress UI, cancel). Not tested with a 2nd render started after a cancelled one.
- Zoom + crop + `replaced` video timing follow the canvas math but were only tested with an image
  replacement; test a replaced *video* clip and a broll crop on real footage.

## Step 3B plan (now implemented, kept for reference)
1. App icon (build/icon.png, referenced from package.json).
2. Ad-hoc signing of the .app and the bundled ffmpeg/ffprobe (afterPack hook), arm64 target.
3. CI sanity step: print `ffmpeg -version` and check for `h264_videotoolbox` from the packaged app.
4. Final Actions run -> .dmg; user does the "unidentified developer" right-click Open once.

## Source of truth
The editor's HTML/CSS/JS in `src/editor.html` was extracted verbatim from the
video-editor section of the user's uploaded `index.html` (originally lines
~926–987 for the panel markup and ~3525–4314 for the script, inside a
larger multi-page site — those line numbers won't mean anything to a fresh
Claude session, they're just provenance). The extraction was a straight copy;
no logic was changed in Step 1. If the user's original `index.html` is
uploaded again in a future session, a diff against that file is the fastest
way to check nothing drifted.

## Known constraints / decisions carried forward
- Electron (not Tauri): the editor uses canvas + WebCodecs heavily; Tauri's
  Safari-based WebView has weaker WebCodecs support.
- ffmpeg builds using libx264 are GPL-licensed — fine for personal use, but
  flag it if the user ever wants to distribute the app publicly. Prefer
  VideoToolbox (Apple's hardware encoder) where possible to sidestep this.
- No Apple Developer account assumed yet ($99/yr) — ad-hoc signing only,
  "unidentified developer" warning is expected and is a one-time click-through.
- Architecture: building for arm64 (M-series) first; add x64 later only if
  the user needs Intel Mac support, bundling the matching ffmpeg binary for
  each.

## What to ask the user when resuming
- Did the Step 3B `.dmg` build (check the Actions "Sanity-check" step output) and open? Does Render video (ffmpeg) finish and play back?
- Speed at 1080p vs 4K (frames/s shown in the status line)? Any error text in the status line?
- Anything to change in the editor itself now that export works?
